This is a simple nodeJS bot.

1. Scrape https://community.sphinx.chat/bounties (default timer every 24hrs).

2. Exctract relevant bounty information. 

3. Post new activities on a specific discord channel.

The bot needs a specific DOM element structure to work. Future versions will call the data from an API to avoid scraping and the resulting limits.

RUN IT YOURSELF:
You need -> node.js@18.16.0 and -> npm@9.6.7 to run the bot
1. Clone/fork this repo
2. Create .env file with the following content:
        DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=<YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN>      <--- create a discord bot here: https://discord.com/developers/
        DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=<YOUR_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID>    <--- easy to copy from discord

If you have never created a discord bot, dont worry, there are tons of short tutorials on youtube and other pages with comprehensive walktroughs and guides.

3. Open a terminal an direct to the cloned repo
4. Run npm install
5. Run npm start

The bot should now operate and post the Sphinx bounties in the discord channel.
Every post gets logged in a JSON file to avoid duplicate posts (if there are no new bounties between two scrapes or if the bot crashes and/or restarts).

The bot code (src/index.js) is commented to give a guide through all its functions.

Used node.js modules:
-discord.js
-puppeteer
-dotenv
